        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
        Josh Harrison began his life in Newport News, VA back in the year of 1993. He spent his younger years in a small trailer in the woods of Glouscester, where he one day wandered off and got lost in the woods. The dark sillhouettes of trees loomed over him as he toddled through the brush. After a few hours of struggling against thistles and thorns that reached for him like hellish claws, panic began to set in. Blood dripped down his arms and legs from his scratches. He realized that he was hopelessly lost, and that it would be impossible to find his way back in the thick blanket of darkness.

        He finally plopped down on a small, mossy log and began to cry a bit. He had never been this lost before. Sure he had gotten seperated from his parents at Walmart before, but that was child's play compared to this. The wind howled through the branches overhead, and the leaves snickered at his misadventure. Josh began to struggle to keep his eyes open as fatigue began to overcome him. Suddenly, there was a growl from the brush behind him. Josh shot up from the log, spun around, and fell to the ground with a thud. He stared ahead in the direction of sound, not blinking, holding his breath. The vines rustled and parted as something began moving toward him.

        Josh's heart tripled in rhythm. He let out his breath and began hyperventalating. The thing was getting closer. All he could do was stare strait ahead and sit on the dirt like a small sack of flour. It was almost upon him now. Josh closed his eyes, waiting for his imminent destruction, surely by the jaws of some devilish beast. Then, a cold nose touched his own. Warm breath flowed past his face and a large tounge kissed his face. He opened his eyes to find himself staring into a large pair of dark eyes surrounded by even darker fur.

        "Doggy?" Josh's voice trembled.
        </p>
        <p>
        This was a monstorously big doggy. It's body was thick, covered in corse, black fur. This was an enormous momma bear.

        The bear took Josh in as one of her cubs, and raised him in the wilds of Shennandoah. He later stumbled into a small town and was taken in by a State Trooper. Josh now attends Towson University as a CIS Major and still loves eating raw fish.

            First off, I love REI. I think I've spent more at REI than I've spent at the grocery store (maybe), but I chose their site because I like the clean, grid layout that they use. I think that the design is smart as well as visually appealing, take the search bar for instance. It's placed right next to the logo at the top so that no one has to search for the search bar, which pretty much defeats the purpose of a search bar. The navbar is also smart in the way they have shoved a ton of menu options into this small navbar by using multiple layers of tabs. The design is clean enough for the information not to get jumbled up in the navbar.
